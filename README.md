## Introduction



**PicoCTF** is a beginner-friendly **Capture The Flag (CTF)** platform designed to teach **cybersecurity fundamentals** through hands-on puzzles. In a CTF, participants solve challenges to uncover hidden **flags**, which are strings of text that confirm a successful solution.

<Strong>Example</strong> of a flag: 'guideToCTF{tH1s_c0uld_b3_a_f1ag_2jg95asn}'.
Flags are unique identifiers for each puzzle, and are complex to stop you from guessing them in a competition.
They are designed to stand out from normal code or language, so that you know when you have found it.
Sometimes, they are encrypted in a cipher so that you won't notice it straight away!

This repository introduces you to **real-world security concepts** by encouraging you to **analyze problems, experiment with tools, and think critically** like cybersecurity professionals.

## What You'll Learn

<ul>
  <li><strong>Linux command line basics</strong> and file system navigation</li>
  <li><strong>Cryptography fundamentals</strong> such as encoding, hashing, and simple ciphers</li>
  <li><strong>Web exploitation concepts</strong> including HTML, JavaScript, and HTTP requests</li>
  <li><strong>Reverse engineering basics</strong> and program analysis</li>
  <li><strong>Introductory binary exploitation</strong> and memory concepts</li>
  <li><strong>Problem-solving and debugging strategies</strong> used in cybersecurity</li>
</ul>

CTF challenges emphasize <strong>hands-on learning, persistence, and creative thinking</strong>. No prior knowledge or experience is required to compete in competitions- you just need to be motivated to learn.

## Getting Started

The first thing you'll need to start is a PicoCTF account. All you need to do is navigate to <a href='picoctf.org'><strong>picoctf.org</strong></a> and sign up for an account. There are a few questions you need to answer, e.g. what school you're at or what grade you are.
Once you have done this, it is a good idea to bookmark this site in your browser. Use *CMD+D* on Mac or *CTRL+D* on Windows.
Click on <strong>PRACTICE</strong> at the top or go to <a href='picoctf.org/practice'><strong>picoctf.org/practice</strong></a>. This part of the website is called the *Pico Gym*, or practice section. It is where you can find all the puzzles you will be trying to solve for practice. In a competition, the puzzles will be new and different to these puzzles. Most puzzles on the site are from previous year's competitions.

Some useful websites:
<ul>
  <li><a href='cyberchef.org'><strong>cyberchef.org</strong></a>:
This website can be used to *decode or decrypt* some multi-layer ciphers and encrypted messages. 
    
I use it mainly for the **Base64 decode** feature which is what most of the codes in PicoCTF are encrypted in.</li>
