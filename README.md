## Introduction



**PicoCTF** is a beginner-friendly **Capture The Flag (CTF)** platform designed to teach **cybersecurity fundamentals** through hands-on puzzles. In a CTF, participants solve challenges to uncover hidden **flags**, which are strings of text that confirm a successful solution.

<Strong>Example</strong> of a flag: 'guideToCTF{tH1s_c0uld_b3_a_f1ag_2jg95asn}'.
Flags are unique identifiers for each puzzle, and are complex to stop you from guessing them in a competition.
They are designed to stand out from normal code or language, so that you know when you have found it.
Sometimes, they are encrypted in a cipher so that you won't notice it straight away!

This repository introduces you to **real-world security concepts** by encouraging you to **analyze problems, experiment with tools, and think critically** like cybersecurity professionals.
